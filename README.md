### Our solution to: identify the most at-risk population using information about vulnerable populations and environmental hazards
Create a platform that uses data about frecuencies of soil moisture, precipitation levels, soil temperature and floods to predict the location where the economic decline should be the lowest in Latin American countries.

## How it works

## Procedures. Step by step
Step 1: Choosing a region and an enviromental hazard to work on.
Step2: Get all posible datasets that contains dates, natural disasters, location per country, economic decline and distribution of population (concerning sex and age).
Step3: (...)

## Results

## Our experience and recomendations
The first part is always the hard one. Defining the population where we were going to centre the analysis, took us a consideratable amount of time, because we had so many variables and locations. The importance is not in cuantity of ideas but the correct organization of them. So remember, true experience is only possible through practice. 

## Conclusions
