### Our solution to: identify the most at-risk population using information about vulnerable populations and environmental hazards
Create a platform that uses data about frecuencies of soil moisture, precipitation levels, soil temperature and floods to predict the location where the economic decline should be the lowest in Latin American countries.

## How it works
Presents the south american region in a grafical globe, which is "decorated" with colors, each one of them with a context. The color represents the level of damage in the econocmical flow of a population.

## Procedures. Step by step
Step 1: Choosing a region and an enviromental hazard to work on.

Step2: We got all posible datasets that contains dates, natural disasters, location per country, economic decline and distribution of population (concerning sex and age).

Step 3: Organized and debugged the relevant characteristics, which drove us to set indicators for prediction of most at risk population in base of its vulnerability (indicators too).

Step4: Usage of visualization tools to represent the analized data in a friendly way to users.

Step5: Determination of the danger zone. 

## Results
Showed us the most-at-risk populations.

## Our experience and recomendations
The first part is always the hard one. Defining the population where we were going to centre the analysis, took us a consideratable amount of time, because we had so many variables and locations. The importance is not in cuantity of ideas but the correct organization of them. So remember, true experience is only possible through practice.
